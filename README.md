# Localinsight

-someone build a streamlit front end plz

-for that just tinker with app.py

-allow users to select what model they want to use so for that use `import ollama` not langchain ollama you can find documentation for that here 'https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python'. like `ollama.list()` 

-requirements file is bloated. don't need all those libraries. maybe just allow your code editor to figure out what you need and create a new requirements file
